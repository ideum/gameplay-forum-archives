          <div style="display:inline-block;width:95%;height:0px;">&nbsp;</div>
          
          <p>I am going to try to make a constructive critique of the software, as I know the people behind GWG are working very hard for 2.0, but the state this current release was in is just too much to not offer my 2cents.</p>

<p>I legally purchased this software for my Dell Venue Pro 8, with the promise that GWG would let me control my games like a controller. It delivers, but the execution is so botched that at times, you&#39;d be better off just using an actual controller. Lets start with the positives:</p>

<ul>
<li>Trial was fair, lightweight and does its job to give you a taste of its features. This is the best way to deal with the temptation of piracy</li>
<li>Buying was easy and instant</li>
<li>Easy to use interface</li>
<li>Adding games was straightfoward</li>
<li>Community features are excellent and a great way to provide access to popular control configs for games </li>
<li>Controls, when available, are functional. You click on them and they work as if its native and being able to resize/color them is neat</li>
<li>In-game editor was a smart idea to allow flexibility during cut-scenes or times when things had to be moved.</li>
</ul>

<p>And thats about it. Now on to the bad:</p>

<ul>
<li>Resourcehog. You can feel this app was designed for a Surface Pro rather than the leaner Baytrail tablets, which means that 2GB of Ram and slower CPU will hurt as soon as you try to move buttons or have certain games (Portal) slowdown. This is a good way of cutting your potential audience whenever GMG and a game hits that RAM limit for whatever reason.</li>
<li>Inflexible UI. The GWG window will start breaking if you rotate the screen or run games in anything below 1280x720, or alt-tab. For multi-taskers, this gets annoying.</li>
<li>Buttons cannot be swiped inbetween to simulate multiple presses. This is a big problem for more complicated games, forcing you to tap them individually.</li>
<li>Serious lack of different control options. We have switches and mouse wheel, but only 1 kind of Dpad. Why?</li>
<li>Garbage mouse control. The joystick is awful, but trying to set it so panning the touchscreen moves the mouse has GWG think your swipes are micro-stutters. This mans games look like they&#39;re lagging when in reality its GWG being unable to smooth it out. Try a proper mouse emulator like TouchMousePointer and see the difference. Utter trash.</li>
</ul>

<p>But the above are issues that can be eventually fixed. Except until we get into the UGLY:</p>

<ul>
<li>Games are compatible as long as they are DX9 and GWG feels like it. That means on weaker systems, you cant enjoy older games without them being recent (indies) or hope they dont break for whatever reason. This seriously undermines any reason to use GWG reliably beyond tested games, its essentially up to you to see if it works.</li>
<li>Slow, slooooow updates. I paid $15 and the most recent update was adding in left/right keyboard command keys? Really? Not even a opt-in beta? </li>
</ul>

<p>As a gamer, I rarely buy software for games. Why would you? Money mostly goes either to hardware or...games. I want to feel as if GWG was as good as an investment as the Steam games that update with free content and so far, there is a very poor sense of GWG improving. Only a news feed showed off v2 ...by showing off you using a separate touchscreen device to control. NO info on improvements. Guys, what are you doing?</p>

<p>So what we have here is a app that works as long as you&#39;re fine essentially being a beta-tester for a specific number of games and emulators - hell forget that, since only select people can test 2.0 whereas everyone else is stuck with 1.0 thats barely updated at all. Even apps like PPSSPP and TouchMousePointer does touchscreen heads-above-heels of what GWG offers and they were free as side projects.</p>

<p>I have no idea how much better 2.0 is, but I have very little faith to recommend anyone buying this in anticipation. See what 2.0 can do and hope the folks here prove me wrong and make the wait worth it. I genuinely hope you guys find success. Thanks for reading this far.</p>

          <p>Hi Mithrot,</p>

<p>We would first of all like to give you a BIG thank you for this in-depth and well thought out feedback!  We absolutely love getting comments like this, because it truly helps us to improve upon what we already have.   </p>

<p>I will try and address things you spoke about and have some questions for you that&#39;d we&#39;d love if you could get back to us on.</p>

<p>Resource hog:  We have done various performance tests on a variety of devices, but this is something we will need to continue to look into.  Thank you for bringing this to our attention, as we will begin doing some testing right away.</p>

<p>Inflexible UI:  I just wanted to get some clarification on this one.  When you say the &quot;GWG screen,&quot; you mean the actual application, correct?  (Not when you&#39;re in a game with Gameplay enabled?) </p>

<p>Buttons cannot be swiped between:  Can you give us a use case where this would work?  Perhaps we could make this optional if it is necessary.  The buttons were intentionally designed so that this wouldn&#39;t happen, so as to reduce accidental button hits. </p>

<p>Lack of different control options:  What else would you like to see?  </p>

<p>Garbage mouse control:  Could you give us an example of which game this is happening to you in so that we may perform testing?</p>

<p>DirectX:  We are aware many people would like to see broader support, and we hope to possibly bring this in a future version.</p>

<p>Slow updates:  We certainly can see where you&#39;re coming from here and will try and be more conscious about this in the future.  </p>

<p>Thank you so much again for all your help and for taking the time to write this all up for us.  We appreciate it!</p>

          <p>I&#39;d also like to thank you for responding. After 3 months of just trying to figure it out in my own, its good to see you guys are active. I&#39;ll try to answer as best as I can. Expect a wall of words!</p>

<ul>
<li>Resource hog: </li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks for looking into this. I wasn&#39;t sure if you were aware of the new Baytrail tablets, but the direction Intel is going with native x86 PC in a small form-factor with battery-life very similar to Android honestly seems like the future of Tablet gaming. Having the team check it out opens up another audience next to Surface owners. But the performance NEEDS to be there too.</p>

<ul>
<li>Inflexible UI: </li>
</ul>

<p>Yes, I was referring to the application window. On a tablet you will be re-sizing, rotating and moving the screen constantly unlike Desktop users. GWG as of now wont let me resize the window by much, and rotating is a big no-no unless you like all the buttons to cram together. I can&#39;t even do what seemed like obvious choices, like getting rid of the community panel if I want to slim down the home screen. Or an options panel, which is relegated to the blue &#39;i&#39; (information icon?). As a user, I want options and right now there isn&#39;t any to customize GWG.</p>

<p>But thats not the only reason. For atleast my Baytrail tablet I have a 12800x800 resolution and GWG HATES it. UI doesn&#39;t scale, so everything becomes small. This gets much worse when you try making/editing controls because the buttons gets pixellated, the logos on them look unreadable and its impossible to click on the color/key options without using TouchMousePointer to accurately click on them. GWG also hilariously breaks when you use the Windows Text Scaling to above 100%, elements balloon to ridiculous portions.</p>

<p>All in all, GWG&#39;s UI was not made for Tablets. It is a desktop application for Mouses and thats a problem for smaller tablets. </p>

<ul>
<li>Buttons cannot be swiped between: </li>
</ul>

<p>Ever used GBCDroid for your android phone? It not only allowed this, but even allowed you to set the &#39;deadzone&#39; of how far your thumb can go before it stopped reading in-between presses.</p>

<p>Why would you need this? Lets look at a game like Super Meat Boy. I have 2 buttons, run &amp; jump. In GWG, I can run. I can jump. But I cannot run AND jump to build momentum, since I cannot slide my thumb from the &#39;run&#39; key to the &#39;jump&#39; key to emulate this. This doesn&#39;t happen for the Dpad either. Hopefully now you understand, this can always be an option which was what GWG desperately lacks. </p>

<p>In fact, PPSSPP does it.Thinking about it now PPSSPP does alot of things way better. Ever used it?</p>

<p>Ask your head UI dev to do me a favor. Install PPSSPP 0.98 and either install a free demo (I recommend MGS Peace Walker) or make sure you own a PSP game to test out (not advocating piracy). Have him enable touch controls on his Surface, what do you think he&#39;ll see?</p>

<p>PPSSPP has a fullscreen, tablet-friendly launcher for all my games, just a click. The controls can be re-sized and moved with only my thumbs, no need for a mouse. The in-game controls feature big, responsive buttons that are easy to use and grow in size everytime you press them. The buttons&#39; look can be customized by switching user-made skins.  Its fast and responsive.This is all done by a free x86 emulator. </p>

<p>Have him and the rest of the team learn from PPSSPP, this is what GWG should be doing for all my DirectX games. Thats a convenience people will pay for.</p>

<ul>
<li>Lack of different control options: </li>
</ul>

<p>I want a free-form joystick that lets me not only use it for mouse/wasd, but for any button(s). 
Allow me to set the deadzones. 
Allow me to set if I want the joystick in 4/6/8 way directions.
Allow me to set one half of the screen so whenever I move my thumb anywhere on that screen, the joystick will appear and move in that direction.</p>

<p>I want the buttons to grow a bit in size when I press them.
I want custom skins.
I want a hudget where its a &#39;slide&#39; bar and when I slide my thumb left or right, buttons will be pressed. Like left/right, for example.
I want a hudget that is literally a box I can resize, so if I set the box to take up one half of the screen, it&#39;ll (for example) reverse my car in Need for Speed.
I want to set if buttons disappear/translucent after not being used for awhile. 
I want the GWG keyboard to appear on the screen smoothly when I press a button, like on Windows 8.
I want to set a resize-able box where if I swipe/tap on that space, keys will be pressed. Kinda like the touchscreen gesture options.</p>

<p>This should give you an idea of what I saw in different android emulators/games. There are thousands of PC Games, GWG had to accommodate like a swiss army knife, even if its pointless.</p>

<ul>
<li>Garbage mouse control: </li>
</ul>

<p>I only tested this on Source games since finding a DirectX 9 FPS that&#39;ll run on my tablet and still work on GMG is too specific to try out. This also happened on Killing Floor.</p>

<p>Install Portal, set some basic WASD and M1/M2 buttons then have the rest of the touchscreen set to be used as mouse-look. Boot up the game into any level. Look around. Notice that it &#39;appears&#39; to lag ad you move the thumbs, but everything else about the game is running fine. This is NOT a performance issue.</p>

<p>Quit the game. Install TouchMousePointer, set it to fullscreen mode thru the taskbar icon. Boot up Portal again, notice how much smoother and accurate TMP emulates the mouse. This is a BIG problem for FPS and TPS games.</p>

<ul>
<li>Slow updates: </li>
</ul>

<p>I hope so! 3 months with only ONE very, very marginal update is very strange for users who game on Steam with updated content all the time. You guys will need to find a way to broaden your update roadmap to avoid looking like vapourware. It keeps people talking.</p>

<p>WOW, that was alot to type on a tablet touchscreen! I hope that expands alot of what was in the OP. Keep us updated!</p>

          <p>Has there been any update on this? Mithrot gives very valid arguments, especially in regards to the run-jump 2button scenario, which is valid for pretty much any and all platform games.</p>

<p>Also, I have a lot of issues with the GWG controller editor window, mostly when using push buttons, Once I add one of those and try to move it around, one of the other buttons starts moving instead.</p>

<p>I am currently in the process of trying to map controllers for games like dead island, state of decay and the like. For dead island I have a 95% working controller to my liking, but for state of decay the controller layer isnt even visible.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for your feedback, I love the product, just wish it had a little more lively community and updates... Oh, I am running a Surface Pro 2 4300U 256Gb.</p>

          <p>Hi 2Elemental, I just posted a VC for Spelunky showing how you can use the &quot;modifier&quot; attribute of buttons to improve usability in games like this. </p>

<p><a href="https://gameplay.gestureworks.com/virtual_controllers/3811-spelunky">https://gameplay.gestureworks.com/virtual_controllers/3811-spelunky</a></p>

<p>The two green buttons next to the dpad are &quot;run&quot; buttons so that you can run and jump more easily. You could also achieve this with the regular dpad and a switch hudget mapped to the shift button, but I think the dedicated buttons are a little easier to use. </p>

<p>We haven&#39;t been able to reproduce your issue with different buttons moving in the editor. It would help us if you could send us a Virtual Controller where this usually happens and a screenshot of how everything is laid out when you see the issue. </p>

<p>Also, we heard from another user who was having trouble with State of Decay. Their fix was to fully shut down the Steam client and launch the game through the tool. Hopefully this helps.</p>

<p>Thanks for the feedback!</p>

          <p>Thanks John, I&#39;ve been able to make my controller work just great with the guidelines you gave me.,Don&#39;t know if it&#39;s still worth it to upload it now, though. I have indeed noticed that closing down Steam does make it work again. To reproduce the issue,you need to use the GWG config screen on a Surface Pro 2 using touch. I am able to reproduce it every time by adding a pushbutton first, ans then adding a normal button. Then while moving or scaling my normal button, the pushbutton moves or scales instead.</p>

<p>Can I also make a few minor suggestions:
1) can you add more glyphs like space, ctrl, alt, shift, delete, backspace and the arrow and function keys?
2) can you provide a solution for the F12-screenshot key, as currently taking a screenshot includes the overlay buttons. can it be made so that a screenshot does not include the overlay buttons?
3) when storing controller xmls on a skydrive, it seems they sometimes don&#39;t correctly overwrite. I have lost some changes due to this as I wanted to go back a version
4) please make the scale +/- buttons larger in the GWG config screen.,currently they are frustratingly small when using touch
5) would it be possinle to provide some sort of snap to grid or just some alignment buttons precision movement controls so it is easier to align UI elements in the GWG config screen?</p>

<p>Thanks for an amazing product!</p>

          <p>Excellent suggestions! We&#39;re actually planning on including many of these features with the release of Gameplay 2: new glyphs, a custom screenshot button (that doesn&#39;t capture the overlay), a better scale interface, and a grid system for creating controllers. </p>

<p>There will be many more new features so keep the suggestions coming. </p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

          <p>I&#39;d like to thank 2Elemental for resurrecting this thread, 20 days without a response isn&#39;t a good sign.</p>

<p>John, out of all the issues I mentioned, the one that really kills GWG for me was the mouse issues when it comes to FPS/TPS games that require you to pan the camera around. The &quot;fake&quot; lag it produces makes aiming imprecise, there is a clear difference when you move the mouse using a program and when you use GWG.</p>

<p>Are you guys aware of the issue and able to fix it? Will it require some form of mouse emulation or smoothing?</p>
